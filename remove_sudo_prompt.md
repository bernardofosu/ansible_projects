# To remove the prompt for the sudo password when running Ansible tasks (or generally on any command) 
You can configure passwordless sudo for your user. This is achieved by modifying the sudoers file to allow a specific user or group to run commands with sudo without being prompted for a password.

## Steps to Enable Passwordless sudo:
#### 1. Edit the sudoers file
Open the sudoers file using the visudo command, which safely allows you to edit the sudoers file.
```bash
sudo visudo
```
This will open the sudoers file in the system's default editor.

#### 2. Modify the sudoers file
Add the following line at the end of the file to allow your user (in this case, server1) to execute commands as root without a password:
```bash
server1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
- server1 is the username for which you want to disable the sudo password prompt.
- ALL means this rule applies to all hosts.
- (ALL) means the user can run commands as any user.
- NOPASSWD: ALL means no password is required for any command.

#### 3. Save and exit
After adding the line, save the changes and exit the editor.
In visudo, you can do this by pressing Ctrl+X to exit, then pressing Y to confirm saving, and pressing Enter to finalize.

#### 4. Verify the configuration
You can now verify that sudo does not prompt for a password by running a simple command with sudo:
```bash
sudo ls
```
It should not ask for a password.
Applying to Ansible:
Once the passwordless sudo configuration is set up for your user, Ansible will also be able to run tasks with sudo without needing to provide the password.

#### Ensure you have ansible_become=true and ansible_become_method=sudo set for the relevant hosts in your Ansible inventory:
```bash
[wsls]
wsl_first_instance ansible_host=172.31.34.168 ansible_port=2223 ansible_user=server2 ansible_become=true ansible_become_method=sudo
```
Now, when you run Ansible commands, it will not prompt for the sudo password.

### Important Note:
Be cautious when setting up passwordless sudo. It can be a security risk if not properly configured, especially if the user has access to a public server. Only apply this to trusted users and systems.
